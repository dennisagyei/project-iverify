The changes in release v.0.4 RC1:

Security fix:

 - Added register_func and register_prefix, to limit the functions that ajaxagent is allowed to call.
 - Security patch with the help from Skv

Bugs:

 - Added the js fix for firefox
 - Fixed a couple of js notice (missing var)
 - Changed the encodeURI to encodeURIComponent from http://ajaxagent.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=153&forum=4
 - Made it possible to return an array to an sync call
 - If we have magic_quotes on, that is not good for array's, remove slashes and then apply slashes after json->php is done.

Changes:

 - Support for non-us characters
 - UTF8 encoding and decoding can be done by ajaxagent
 - Added a testbed for agent devolpment - it's realy not pretty code - but it's getting the job done... agent_test.php and agent_test.js
 - Added support for php 5.2 builtin JSON parser - thanks SKv
 - Updated json.js from json.org
 - Updated Service_JSON to 1.31
 - Added function to show a div during ajax calls. For the moment it's controlled by setting vars in js, line 328 and 329.

   var Agent_ShowWorking = 1;  // Set to true if you want AjaxAgent to do display a div during work.
   var Agent_ShowWorkingDiv = 'AjaxWorking';  // Name of the div we would like to show / hide

   There is a check if the div to show / hide exsist - if you don't have div called AjaxWorking - well nothing will happen, but if you do - magic will appear...

Added functions to class Agent:

 - agent_process(); 												processing the calls to ajaxagent
 - init_return(); 													to return the js, to be used whith smarty etc.
 - my_debug($func, $str); 											to help debugging
 - options($convert_to_utf8 = false, $convert_from_utf8 = false);	setting utf8 encoding/decoding
 - register_func($str);												registering funktions that are allowed to be called
 - register_prefix($str);											setting the prefix that all functions need to have to be allowed to be called
 - stripslashes2($str);												removing slashes from an array
 - detectUTF8($str);												returns true if the string contains utf8
 - addslashes_array($a);											adding slashes to an array
 - do_utf8_encode_array($a);										utf8 encoding an array (only the values are decoded)
 - do_utf8_decode_array($a);										utf8 decoding an array (only the values are decoded)
