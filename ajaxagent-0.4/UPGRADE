UPGRADE

0.3 -> 0.4:

It should be a drop in replacement, copy the new agent.php over your existing agent.php 
and you are ready to go. Please do a backup of agent.php before though.

To be able to take advantage of utf8 en/decoding, limiting the functions AjaxAgent can call 
and deciding where to process the calls (in your php file), you need to do like this:

	//  First a define, to tell AjaxAgent not to process calls.
	define('AJAXAGENT_ADVANCED', 1);

	//  No comments
	include_once('agent.php');

	//  Only functions beginning with ajax_ are allowed, you could use register_func('func_name'); 
	//  instead (multiple times - for each function you want to add).
	$agent->register_prefix('ajax_');

	//  enabling UTF8 encoding and decoding of the data sent and received, they are disabled by default.
	$agent->options(true, true);

	//  Here the calls from agent.call() are processed. You should put this after any authentications etc.
	$agent->agent_process();

	//  Returning the javascript init as an string instead of echoing. Good for Smarty etc.
	$js = $agent->init_return(); 

There is more info in CHANGES.
